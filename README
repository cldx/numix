This Set is incomplete, don't clone it if you expect a complete Icon Set that doesn't suck in various places :P
Expect small daily updates.

Some Icons blatantly stolen from, Elementary, Humanity and Nutrix Icon Themes for reference and Icon Names.
Highly influenced by the Gnome Symbolic Icons (which are used too in some places)

There is NO LIGHT VARIANT yet! So don't bother using it if you have a Dark Theme.

KTHXBYE
